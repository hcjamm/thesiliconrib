if you do not walk away, thanks.
i build this project because of a question. why god build man and women but do not let them be together easily?
i dont know if there is real god. but every time a girl left me and think i'm an asshole, i did learn something, some skill. as now, i've learned audio process, 3D modeling, and programning. i realiesed, that if i keepping being tossed, some day i be a master of art and machinery! that would be sad ... really really sad...

yes. i build this open-source project because if your experience like mine, we could build high-technologed girlfriend for us. and if we know carving, machinery, audio process, painting, speech recognision system, face recognishion system, motion capture ... we can do that!

this project will be a 100% opensourced project! i persist to do that! maybe we can sale 1st gen of our works for funds, that would not be expensive. as much as an iphone i think..

thank you! whether you need thanks or not!
